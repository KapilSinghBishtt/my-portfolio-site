# my-portfolio-site
My personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a Full Stack MERN Developer. This responsive website highlights who I am, what I do, and what I’ve been building — all in one place. Simple, clean, and built from scratch as a reflection of my learning and growth.
